# Installation

## Download

### Prequisitions (installed)

* VRChat
* Unity (tested on Version 2018.1.5f1 Personal)

### Via Zip File

Download the project as a Zip File and exctract the whole content into a directory of your choice.

### Via git

For the purpose of having the same development environment on every system each of my git projects is deployed in a *git* Folder in the Root Directory.
To get the same Folder enter the following on your commandline. 

```bash
cd /
mkdir git
cd git
```

After successfully creating the directory (if it doesen't allready exist) you can go ahead and clone the repository via git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/socialyzeio/vrchatExampleMap.git
```

## Setting up the Project

Start Unity and Open the Project through the [Open] Option in the first window or over *File* -> *Open Project...* when you are allready on the Main Screen.
Now you only need to login to your vrchat Account in *VRChatSDK* -> *Settings* and you are finished.

## Building the Project (Open the Map in VRChat)

The Project can be build and started over *VRChatSDK* -> *Show Build Control Panel* here you need to click [New Build] in the Test Section.
If everything is correctly setup VRChat should open after some time and start to load the Map. 
Now you should be able to see a "Chair" behind and a White Ground underneath you.
